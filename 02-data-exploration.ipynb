    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll take an opportunity to explore the data we'll be using.\n",
    "Data exploration and understanding is a fundamental step in Machine Learning, and often will be one of the key steps.\n",
    "You may even spend all or most of the time understanding the data better so that your model can understand it better\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the data we'll be looking at is the MNIST data set. This is a very common almost \"hello world\" style problem in today's machine learning landscape. It consists of 60,000 examples of handwritten digits, with a label corresponding to what the intended digit is. It's worth mentioning that in ML, 60,000 examples is considered a fairly small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to know a few characteristics about the dataset in this course in particular. Specifically how it's laid out. In the MNIST dataset we have provided, we have done some preprocessing of the data. The data you'll be provided is in CSV format, with the first digit corresponding to the actual value, and the rest of them corresponding to a 28x28 pixel image of the digit. That 28x28 pixels is flattened in our image into 784 individual pixel elements. Each pixel element is in the range of \\[0,255\\] which corresponds to a greyscale. In the case of a color image, we might have each element be a triple which would correspond to an (R,G,B) value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will be used to train our model to recognize the relationship between the pixel values of the 28x28 image, and the digit that we tell the model that the pixel values correspond to. The goal of the neural network that we develop over the course of this lab will be to take in an image of a digit, and correctly classify it by outputting the correct digit. No neural network is going to be perfect, but we hope to achieve high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy in this lab is defined specifically as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $ Accuracy = {Correct\\_Predictions \\over Total\\_Predictions} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this metric isn't always the optimal metric for every situation, and some ML systems will need different metrics, but for the purposes of this course, it will work well enough\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through this notebook, feel free to explore the data a bit, change which examples, axis, etc, that we look at, and really get a good understanding of the data we're working with. It's a vital skill in the toolbox of any data scientist, engineer, or machine learning expert.\n",
